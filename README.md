# RhoSquared
RhoSquared is a simple interface for the FRITAV database. FRITAV stands for "FRench and ITAlian Verbal roots" and the database was built as part of a larger project analyzing the analogical dynamics of verbal roots in Old French and Old Italian. This script manages (simple!) queries to a PostgreSQL database containing the final data of the project.

This is a true beta version. Massive refactoring must be undertaken in order to ensure an easier upkeep and a smoother user experience. We are planning to do such work in the month of October 2020 and we therefore welcome each and every issue report.
