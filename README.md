# RhoSquared
RhoSquared is a simple interface for the FRITAV database. FRITAV stands for "FRench and ITAlian Verbal roots" and the database was built as part of a larger project analyzing the analogical dynamics of verbal roots in Old French and Old Italian. This script manages (simple!) queries to a PostgreSQL database containing the final data of the project.
